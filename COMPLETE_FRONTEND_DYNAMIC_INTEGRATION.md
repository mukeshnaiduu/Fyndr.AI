## Technical Implementation

### Real-Time Infrastructure
```javascript
// Common imports across all pages
import { 
  useRealTimeConnection, 
  useRealTimeJobMatching, 
  useRealTimeApplications,
  useRealTimeTracking 
} from 'services/hooks/useRealTime';
import { dynamicAPI } from 'services/api/dynamicAPI';
import { realTimeService } from 'services/realTimeService';
```

### State Management Pattern
```javascript
// Real-time state structure used across pages
const [realTimeMode, setRealTimeMode] = useState(false);
const [userProfile, setUserProfile] = useState(null);
const [applicationUpdates, setApplicationUpdates] = useState({});

// Dynamic hooks integration
const { isConnected } = useRealTimeConnection();
const { matches, startMatching, stopMatching } = useRealTimeJobMatching();
const { applyDynamically } = useRealTimeApplications();
const { trackingData, subscribeToApplication } = useRealTimeTracking();
```

### Dynamic Application Processing
```javascript
// Enhanced apply function with dynamic processing
const handleApply = useCallback(async (jobId) => {
  try {
    if (realTimeMode) {
      // Use dynamic application service
      const result = await applyDynamically(jobId, {
        autoCustomize: true,
        followExternalLinks: true,
        notes: 'Applied with dynamic processing'
      });
      
      if (result.success) {
        // Update UI with application status
        setJobs(prevJobs =>
          prevJobs.map(job =>
            job.id === jobId ? { 
              ...job, 
              hasApplied: true, 
              applicationId: result.application_id 
            } : job
          )
        );
      }
    } else {
      // Fallback to standard API
      // ... standard implementation
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Application failed:', error);
  }
}, [realTimeMode, applyDynamically]);
```
